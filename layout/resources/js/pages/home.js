            During our vistit, we had sandwiches - Cubano and Pastrami. The Pastrami had a hefty serving of, well, pastrami, cracked black peppers giving a nice lift to the crispy toasted sourdough slices it was housed in. A classic sandwich for those looking for something simple but flavorful. The Cubano was more complex in flavor, the mustard, pork, ham, pickles with a slight kick from jalapenos livening up my palate. Not traditional as it was also served between sourdough bread slices, but the bread was delicious and perfect in texture, so easily forgiven.<br><br>
            
            Service was spotty in terms of product knowledge, but perhaps the server was new. Other than that, overall customer experience was good.`,
